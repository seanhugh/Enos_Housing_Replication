## Replication Code for Ryan Enos

I replicate the Paper ["What the Demolition of Public Housing Teaches Us about the Impact of Racial Threat on Political Behavior"](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/renos/files/enoschicago.pdf) by Ryan Enos using r code and [data from the Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26612). 

The file data.turnout.csv was too large to be added to Github, and is avaliable online at the [Harvard dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/26612).
